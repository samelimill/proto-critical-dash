# Timed Javascript Quiz
![JS badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-green?logo=javascript)

## Description
Here I've built a basic multiple choice quiz. Much of this project revolves around furthering my understanding of Javascript and Web APIs.
As the user progresses through the quiz, wrong answers will detract ten seconds from the clock, with the final time remaining being the final score.
After the user enters their initials, their name and score are added to an array in local storage, which then gets displayed by the 'View High Scores' button, where the user has the option to clear out previously saved scores.
